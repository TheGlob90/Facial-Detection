# Facial-Detection
Before you start, make sure you have Python 3 installed and have cv2 and pillow installed.
```
pip install pillow, opencv-contrib-python
```
To run the program, run the command below.
```
python3 gui_test.py haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
```
When you first download the repo, remove all of the text in Names.txt so you can add your own names to the file.

NOTE: Neither the pictures that are used to train the model nor the model itself are saved through git.
